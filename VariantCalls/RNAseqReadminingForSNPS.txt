#In VCF file format first variant is reference and second is from read. Next column gives a quality score
#In the last column will see 0/0 if homozygous to reference, 1/1 if homozygous alternative to reference, 1/0 or 0/1 if Heterozygous, 1/2 if 2 #alternate alleles from reference is found, this is followed by the number of reads for each one separated by a dot or comma

#Explanation of numbers in previous line
# is quality score followed by conventional annotation 0/1 which means Heterozygous after the colon : is the amount of reads of each one, so in this case 7 reads of the reference and 9 of the alternative which is T corresponding to Haplotype 2 in 10X sequencing.  
Need to look back at all of previous results because I did not look for the heterozygosity indicator so some may also have the reference allele read (so both blocks)
Can try to filter only homozygous reads but can already conclude that these are not really strand specific or did not use the correct way of filtering them, will also consult with the core and google about their method of finding strandedness.  For this assay I used ribodepletion prep as part of their RNA-seq package.
